 # Unit 20 State Homework: üè¨ Online Marketplace

In this assignment, you will be creating a marketplace that allows users to view products from Best Buy. The user will be able to view details about the product, and if they decide, add the product to a shopping cart.

## Instructions

```
As a customer, I want to be able to search through Best Buy's directory and add items to my shopping cart. Once I'm finished shopping, I want to be able to navigate to my shopping cart and view a short summary of the items that I purchased.
```


* The server has already been provided for you. It will be up to you to decide how to style your application.


*  It is recommended that you include the following pages:

  * A Home page that displays "top" products. The user should be able to search for keywords.

  * A Shopping Cart page that displays all items in their cart. Users should be able to remove items from their cart, view a subtotal, and adjust quantities of each item in their cart.

### Hints

* Try making your application functional before worrying about styling it. 

* It is recommended that you outline the different elements of global state your application will need before writing any code.

## Bonus

* Add a `LOADING` action to your global state and display a loader to indicate that the user is waiting on data.

* Add user authentication to your application. All of the server side routes have already been provided.
